#Cursor location and file status:
---------------------------------
		-"ctrl+g" shows file name, file status, line number, line percentage and column number of the cursor.
		-"G(shift+g)" takes the cursor to the bottom of the file.
		-"gg" brings it back to where text begins.
		-"<line number>+shift+g" takes the cursor to specified line.

#Search command:
----------------
		-"/<search text>" searches for the specified text in the document after the current cursor location.
		-"n" takes the cursor to the next occurance of that phrase.
		-"N" takes the cursor to the previous occurance of that phrase. "N" basically searches in the reverse direction of "n".
		-"?<search text>" searches for the occurance of the specified text before the current cursor location.
		-"ctrl+o" takes the cursor to its previous position by one step at a time.

#Matching parenthesis search:
-----------------------------
		-Pressing "%" while the cursor is on a bracket takes the cursor to its matching bracket. Pressing "%" while the cursor in on 
		 a opening parenthesis, takes the cursor to its matching closing parenthesis. Pressing "%" while the cursor is on a "}" takes
		 the cursor to its matching opening curly brace "{".
		-This is a very handy tool to debug an unmatched  bracket.

#The Substitute command:
------------------------
		-":s/<old>/<new>/g" replaces all the occurances of "old" with "new" in the current sentence.
		-Note: ":s/<old>/<new>" replaces only the first occurance of "old" with "new". Adding "g" tells VIM to substitute globally in the sentence.
		-":#,#s/<old>/<new>/g" replaces all the occureances of "old" with "new" within the line numbers specified by #.
		-":%s/<old>/<new>/g" replaces all the occurances of "old" with "new" in the whole document.
		-":%s/<old>/<new>/gc" performs the same action, but promts the user on whether to replace each occurance or not.
