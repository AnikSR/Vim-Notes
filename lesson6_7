# Set search pattern:
=====================
	- ":set ic" sets the ignore case option. Now ":/<phrase>" will ignore the upper and lowercase in the <phrase>.
	- ":set noic" will turn off the ignore case option.
	- "hlsearch" or the highlight search option will highlight all the occurance of searched phrase in the document. ":set hlsearch" or
	   ":set hls" command will enable this option and ":set nohlsearch" or ":no hlsearch" or "no hls" will disable this.
	- "incsearch" or the incremental search option heighlighs all the partial matches for the search phrase. ":set is" or ":set incsearch
	  enables this option.
	- The disable command for incremental search is ":nois".
	* note: ":hi search" command shows search options like highlight color.

# Set line number:
==================
	- ":set number" and ":set nu" shows line number at the left side of the document.
	- ":set nonumber" and ":set nonu" turns off the line number.

* In generally prepending "no" before any command in set option will turn off that command.

# Geting Help:
==============
	- Press F1 or type ":help" command to turn on the help document.
	- ":help <topic>" will take directly to the portion of the help document with <topic>.

# Command maching and tab completion:
=====================================
	- Pressing ctrl+d after a partial command name typed after ":" will list all the matching cammand names. Example:
	  pressing :e ctrl+d returns a list:

	  earlier      echoerr      echomsg      edit         elseif       endfor       endif        endwhile     ex           exit
	  echo         echohl       echon        else         emenu        endfunction  endtry       enew         execute      exusage
	
	  It contains all the commands starting with letter 'e'.

	- Pressing 'tab' after a partial command name typed after ":" will complete the partial name to the first matching command. Pressing
	  tab again will return the next best matching command and so on. Like in the previous example, pressing tab after ":e" will complete
	  it to "earlier", pressing tab again will bring the command "echo" and so on.

* To set different option for vim the .vimrc file must be scripted accordingly. Introduction to .vimrc file and vim scripting can be found by using ":help vimrc-intro" command.
